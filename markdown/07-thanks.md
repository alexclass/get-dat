# Thanks!

That's it, you're done with the core part of the introduction to dat! There is an extra credit lesson available if you have the time.

Dat is still in beta, and we're working hard on making dat more awesome in the future. 

To learn more about dat you can check out our <a href="https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/docs" target="_blank">getting started guide</a> or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/dat_project" target="_blank">@dat_project</a> on Twitter.
