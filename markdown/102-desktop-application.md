# Extra Credit: Desktop Application

If you'd like to try a different workflow for managing Dat repositories, we have developed a Desktop application called Dat Desktop. You can install it from [https://datproject.org/install](https://datproject.org/install) for Mac or Linux (Windows coming soon).

The Desktop application is intended to make Dat more approachable for users that prefer not to use the command line for everything. Give it a try and let us know what you think!
