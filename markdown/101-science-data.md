# Extra Credit: Distributing Scientific Data

Now that you've used Dat to share example data, give it a spin using some of your own research data, or data that you've used in the past.

Here are some example pages with data on them to give you ideas, but we encourage you to give Dat a spin with some data that you already have downloaded or published before.

- Recent Earthquake CSVs: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/csv.php
- Recently published DOIs (JSON): https://api.crossref.org/works?sort=updated&order=desc&rows=10&select=DOI,title,link,deposited

Once you have data files in a folder on your machine, simply run `dat create` in the folder to start tracking the data with Dat. 

To complete this lesson, run `dat share` and share the link with another workshop attendee and see if they can access your data.
