# dat init

When you are asked to "run" something it means you should enter it in your terminal.

1. There should be a `welcome.txt` file. You can read it by typing `cat welcome.txt`.

1. Now run `ls`. This displays a list of all files in the directory.

1. Run `dat init`. This will establish the current directory as a dat repository, with datâ€™s data stored `data.dat`. You'll also see a `package.json` file, which will be used to store configuration data. We'll get to that later.

1. Run `ls` again and note that `data.dat` is now listed.

The `data.dat` directory is where dat's data is stored.

Got it?
