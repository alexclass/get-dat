# dat init

When you are asked to "run" something it means you should enter it in your terminal.

1. Download the contents of this repository and navigate to its directory at the terminal.
1. Run `dat init`. This will establish the current directory as a dat repository. You'll be prompted for a name, description, and publisher for your new dataâ€”just hit "enter" to accept the suggested defaults.

You now have a dat repository! dat's internal data store is in a new directory, named `data.dat`.
