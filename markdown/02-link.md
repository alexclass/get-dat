# Sharing data

In this folder, you'll see:

  - `bob.png`, a wonderful picture of Bob Marley.
  - `welcome.txt`, information about this server.

Let's get these files to your local machine using `dat`.

## `dat link`

First, let's create a link that represents these files. Type:

```
$ dat link
```

This will create a link, that looks like `dat://...`. This is a unique hash, generated by the contents of the files (including those in subdirectories) inside the current directory. Dat ignores hidden files.

Your output might look something like this:

```
$ dat link
Scanning folder, found 98 files in 5 directories. 47.12 MB total.

Serving data (1 connection(s))
```

The data will now available on the Internet. If I want to share this data with someone else, I'll need to open port 3282 (DATA) on my local network. On this Docker image, we've already done that.

## Downloading

Copy that link. On your local computer, type:

```
dat <link here>
```

The files will be downloaded inside of the current directory. The process will stay open, re-hosting the data to ensure redundancy of the data. Great!
